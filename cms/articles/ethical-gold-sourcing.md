Introduction
============

Ghana, a leading global gold producer, has increasingly relied on gold purchases to enhance economic stability. The **Domestic Gold Purchase Programme (DGPP)** launched by the **Bank of Ghana (BoG)** in 2021 seeks to boost foreign exchange reserves through initiatives like **Gold4Oil** and **Gold4Reserves**. However, the challenge remains in balancing these economic goals with **environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing**, particularly within the **artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM) sector**.

In this two-part series, **Blay & Associates** examines the evolving landscape of **gold sourcing in Ghana** through the **Domestic Gold Purchase Programme (DGPP)**, concerns over **illegal mining, environmental degradation, and human rights violations** persist, making responsible gold sourcing a critical policy priority.

Part I
------

Part I explores the **Bank of Ghana’s Responsible Gold Sourcing Policy Framework**, introduced in 2024, which aims to align Ghana’s gold industry with **international ethical standards** while ensuring financial resilience. This framework is crucial in addressing the **challenges of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM)** and balancing Ghana’s economic and environmental responsibilities. We assess Ghana’s **gold sourcing model**, comparing it with global best practices in **Mongolia, Ecuador, the Philippines, and Ethiopia**, and highlight how Ghana leads among **African gold-producing nations** in integrating sustainability into its gold reserves strategy.

We also analyse the **five key gold sourcing channels under the DGPP**, the implementation of **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Due Diligence (DD) procedures**, and the **compliance mechanisms** that safeguard the integrity of Ghana’s gold market. The article underscores the framework’s emphasis on **transparency, risk management, and sustainability**, particularly in fostering **ethical mining, reducing environmental impact, and improving the livelihoods of mining communities**.

‍

Part II
-------

Looking ahead, **Part II** will delve into the anticipated **establishment of Ghana’s Gold Board**, its potential **impact on policy enforcement**, and the broader implications for **Ghana’s position in the global gold market**. As the country refines its approach to **sustainable gold sourcing**, the ongoing evolution of its regulatory framework will determine its ability to **balance economic growth with responsible resource management.**
