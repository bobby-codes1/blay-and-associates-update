Lucie Blay, also known by her stool name Nana Opetse II, is a Senior Partner at Blay & Associates. With an extraordinary legal career spanning over five decades, she stands as a pillar of wisdom, leadership and legacy in Ghana’s legal fraternity.

When she was called to the Bar over five decades ago, she couldn’t have imagined the journey that lay ahead. To Lucie, the legal profession has been more than a profession. To her, it has been a calling, a tool for justice, and a way to serve her community with integrity and compassion.

Lucie Blay has a simple but firm belief that the practice of law must always be grounded in truth, fairness, and respect for every individual. Over the years, Lucie Blay has worked with exceptional colleagues, mentoring bright young minds, and contributing in her own way to the growth of the law firm.

As a recipient of the Ghana Bar Association’s 2025 Honour for Distinguished Legal Service, Nana Opetse II has dedicated an impressive 55 years to the Bar, earning her place among Ghana’s most respected legal minds. Her recognition by the Bar is a reflection not only of her personal achievements but also of her role in shaping the firm’s reputation for excellence, integrity, and commitment to justice. To her, being recognized by the Ghana Bar Association for 55 years of service was a humbling milestone however, her true reward lies in seeing the next generation of lawyers rise confident, principled and prepared to carry the torch forward.

As a Queen Mother, she also holds dearly the importance of tradition, heritage, and community. These values have shaped her approach to both leadership and law.

Lucie Blay has been extremely grateful for her journey so far and remains committed to this path. She is extremely hopeful about the future of the profession.
